empyrean_api_universal
======================

The universal "API" (Not Really)

Bug fixes won't be renamed or put in a new folder when uploaded unless they are incompatible with old versions.

This is more of an interface that makes it easy to access variables without an actual API.
All outputs are in raw data.
Remember, if an API is available for your language, use it instead!
Available APIs:
C/C++: www.github.com/ElysiumWare/empyrean_api_c/

Write to %INSTALLDIR%/eapi_input.aio to make an output on eapi_output.aio or eapi_integer.aio.

To get the screen width write 'w'. The output will be in eapi_integer.aio.

To get the screen height write 'h'. The output will be in eapi_integer.aio.

To get the user name write 'u'. The output will be in eapi_output.aio.
